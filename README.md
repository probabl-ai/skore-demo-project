# skore-demo-project

Welcome to this short scripting repository.  
If you want to explore skore-hub but do not know where to start, here are a couple of creations to create objects.  

To start, you should first create a virtual environment. Once set, you can run the following lines in your terminal:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
skore-hub-login
python demo.py
```
